An overcomplicated React app to view GitHub details of an user. The project has been made a tad more complicated to learn a bit about various react features like - Portals, Hooks, etc.

## TODO

- [x] Use fetch hook and create a simple page that displays user's image and name
- [x] Create Context provider and move all data there
- [x] Fetch all of user's repositories and show them

- [x] Display selected repo's readme
- [ ] Theme and styling
- [ ] Check async/await setup
