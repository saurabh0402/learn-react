# learn-react
A repository containing a few simple, mini projects I build in React.js

## How to run any project?
The dist folder is already present in all the projects. All you need to do is open the `index.html` file present in the dist folder of the project you want to run. That's it. :smiley:

## 
To build the code after you have made changes, you will need `webpack`. Follow these steps to set up any project:
* Run `npm install -g webpack` to install `webpack` globally.
* cd into the project folder you want to build. Eg. `cd random-user`
* Run `npm install`. This will install all the dependenices.
* Make changes. Run `webpack` to build the project.
* Open `dist/index.html` to see the result
